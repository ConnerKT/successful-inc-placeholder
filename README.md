# Successful Inc
Project redesigning Successful Incs new website

**Current Build** [*Here*](https://www.successfulinc.org/)

---------------------------------

We will post *any* notes we have regarding this project in the README. If there's anything important that we can't lose or information to keep in mind it will go here as with
any project. 

---------------------------------

Currently our only guidelines are to use the logo they have (though I think making a smaller version for a collapsable nav bar would be pretty cool) and to be able to protect

the images of the children. As it stands I know he will want to be able to add more pictures in, so if we could make a screen that only say an admin user could be able to upload

photos that would be awesome but it wouldn't be something we implement till much later, food for thought.

---------------------------------

As for timing we will be meeting every Tuesday and Thursday at **3:30** and ending at **4:30** time permitting. Working on the project will be your responsibility and I will not be chasing anyone down, remember this will be replacing your final project so let that be your motivation. That said if you need assisstance please feel free to reach out and I can offer guidance.
